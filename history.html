<p>During 28,000 BCE, during the late Paleolithic period, Venus of Dolní Věstonice was created in what is now the Czech Republic. This scultpure of a woman is the oldest known ceramic artifact.</p>

<p>Humans started to use ceramics more during the Neolithic period, specifically in 9,000 BCE, as settled communities needed vessels for containing water and food.
At this time, ceramic art, tiles and bricks also became popular. These pieces were sun-dried, then fired at a low temperature (below 1,000&#8451) in kilns dug into the ground.</p>

<p>Clay is a natural material made of rock that became malleable and when heated at high temperature, will harden permanently.</p>

The early products were just dried in the sun or fired at low temperature (below 1,000°C) in rudimentary kilns dug into the ground. 
Pottery was either monochrome or decorated by painting simple linear or geometric motifs.

One of the first breakthroughs in the fabrication of ceramics was the invention of the wheel, in 3,500 BCE. 
The introduction of the wheel allowed for the utilization of the wheel-forming technique to produce ceramic artifacts with radial symmetry.

Throughout the 1500s, earthenware remained the main class of ceramic products manufactured in Europe and the Middle East.  
The Chinese were the first to introduce high temperature kilns capable of reaching up to 1350°C,
