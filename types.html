<h3>1. Kaolin (Porcelain)</h3>
<p>Kaolin is a mineral originally found in China, clay made from this material was created in 600 CE.
People often use the word "porcelain" to describe kaolin clay but porcelain is actually the word for fired kaolin clay.</p>
<p>This clay is harder to work with as it has a lower plasticity than other types.
Pure kaolin clay is fired at the highest kiln (oven for firing clay) temperature: 1800&#8451.
Although, it is often mixed with other types of clay to increase workability. Mixed clay is fired at a lower temperature.</p>
<p>Unbaked kaolin clay is light-grey, while fired kaolin clay is white.</p>

<h3>2. Stoneware</h3>
<p>Stoneware ceramic pieces date back to 1900 BCE, many from the Indus Valley Civilization of what is now India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
<p>Stoneware contains kaolin as well as other minerals. It has a coarser texture and a dark grey colour.
This clay is easier to work with and is known as the strongest type of pottery.</p>
<p>Stoneware can be mid-fire or high-fire. Mid-fire stoneware is fired at 1177-1238&#8451, high-fire is at 1205-1280&#8451.</p>

<h3>3. Earthenware</h3>
<p>Earthenware clay was used in the earliest form of pottery. It is used for many things like making bricks and vessels because it is easy to shape by hand or with tools.</p>
<p>It is made of iron and other minerals. The mix of minerals can make earthenware clay red, orange, yellow or light grey.</p>
<p>Stoneware is fired at 952-1100&#8451 and must be glazed to be impervious to water unlike kaolin and stoneware clay.</p>
